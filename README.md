First steps in establishing a real public portfolio of work.

This was built using no libraries with no dependencies. The page pulls from a REST API as a proof of concept for a chatting list.  To view, simply right click index.html and view it in a browser.  Please be sure to check it out on a mobile viewport.  It scales down quite well.
